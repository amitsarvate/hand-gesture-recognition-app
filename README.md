# Hand Gesture Recognition App

This project is designed to recognize hand gestures using machine learning techniques. It includes datasets, pre-trained models, and scripts necessary for training and deploying a hand gesture recognition system.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the datasets used for training and testing the models.
- **imgs/**: Includes sample images related to hand gestures.
- **models/**: Stores pre-trained models for hand gesture recognition.
- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (can be installed via `requirements.txt` if available)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amitsarvate/hand-gesture-recognition-app.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd hand-gesture-recognition-app
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (if a `requirements.txt` file is present):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Place your hand gesture images in the `data/` directory, organized into subdirectories for each gesture class.

2. **Training the Model**:
   - Use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to preprocess the data and train the model. For example:
     ```bash
     python scripts/train_model.py
     ```

3. **Evaluating the Model**:
   - After training, evaluate the model's performance using:
     ```bash
     python scripts/evaluate_model.py
     ```

4. **Running the Application**:
   - Deploy the trained model to recognize hand gestures in real-time:
     ```bash
     python scripts/run_app.py
     ```
